Theory:

●	With the introduction of the so many ecommerce webites, it is important for a buyer to understand the price of various products on different ecommerce platforms. Many different websites, like amazon, flipkart, ebay, etc. are considered as top ecommerce websites when it comes to electronics. But certain other sites such as croma, shopclues, snapdeal are also in competition. Thus every website has o provide discounts and thus the prices oa a product vary from one website to another
●	Thus an online real time price comparison webiste is necessary which may aid the user in choosing the best website where he could buy the intended product. The customer may also want a price alert regarding price drops on his desired product.



Why Price Comparison is so important

●	During holiday seasons on festivals, a lot of sales and deals are going on, on various ecommerce websites. A customer, before buying a product, may select a budget. The customer may only have knowledge about amazon and there may be no sale going on, on Amazon. The price of the product may not fall under his budget and he may drop the idea of buying it. He may be unaware that a sale is present on Flipkart due to which the product now comes within the customer’s budget. In such a case, the customer may need price comparisons.
